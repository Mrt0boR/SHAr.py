# SHAr.py
I have recently been teaching myself Python3 and whilst browsing modules in the kali workstation I was building on my native OS I noticed a SHA256 module. 
I decided to understand the capabilities of this module and set about creating and devloping this coding product as an incentive to learn and develop my skillset further.
I know SHA256 encryptions can be done in various browsers and by other far more complex tools. However, I just want to immerse myself in the field. Hence, why this project 
exists.
